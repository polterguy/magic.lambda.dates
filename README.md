# Magic Lambda Dates

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.lambda.dates.svg?master)](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.lambda.dates)

Date manipulation library for [Magic](https://github.com/polterguy/magic). More specifically, it gives you the following slots.

* __[date.now]__ - Returns the now date, equivalent of `DateTime.Now`.
* __[date.format]__ - Returns a string representation of some date, formatted according to the specified **[format]** argument.
* __[time]__ - Creates a time span, useful for adding and subtracting offsets to date objects. Pass in **[days]**, **[hours]**, **[minutes]**, **[seconds]** and **[milliseconds]** to declare how large your offset is. All arguments are optional, but (of course) on argument should be passed in.

## License

Although most of Magic's source code is publicly available, Magic is _not_ Open Source or Free Software.
You have to obtain a valid license key to install it in production, and I normally charge a fee for such a
key. You can [obtain a license key here](https://servergardens.com/buy/).
Notice, 5 hours after you put Magic into production, it will stop functioning, unless you have a valid
license for it.
